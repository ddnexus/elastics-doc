        This rake task reads the configuration `elastics.yml` file with your custom mappings, merges it with the internally generated mapping and routings, and creates the index. It is important to run this task when you start a new app, specially if you use the `elastics-models` gem with parent/child relationships {% see 4 %}.

        #### Environment variables

        This task can be customized with the following environment variables:

        * `FORCE` Deletes the existing indices before running. Default `false`.
        * `INDEX` String representing one or a list of indices to create. Default: `Elastics::Configuration.variables[:index]`.

      | {% shighlight sh %}
        $ rake elastics:index:create INDEX=foo,bar
        {% endshighlight %}

        Deletes the index/indices.

        #### Environment variables

        This task can be customized with the following environment variables:

        It imports all or any of the models of your application.

        #### Environment variables

        This task can be customized with the following environment variables:

        * `FORCE` Deletes the existing indices before reindexing. Default `false`.
        * `BATCH_SIZE` The batch size used to retrieve the records and bulk post to the elasticsearch server. Default `1000`.
        * `TIMEOUT` The HTTP-client timeout. Default `20` for this task. (it is usually `5` for regular queries as set in `Configuration.http_client_options[:timeout]`). You might need a higher timeout if you raise the `BATCH_SIZE`.
        * `IMPORT_OPTIONS` A query string like string representing a hash of options to be used with the `find_in_batches` methods.
        * `CONFIG_FILE` The configuration file. Default `Elastics::Configuration.config_file`
        * `MODELS` Array like string representing a list of model classes. Default `Elastics::Configuration.elastics_models`.

        It dumps the index/indices to a dump file, which can be feed to the `elastics:admin:load` task to reload/restore the index.

        #### Environment variables

        This task can be customized with the following environment variables:

        * `FILE` The path to the dump file. Default: `'./elastics.dump'`
        * `INDEX` String representing one or a list of indices to dump. Default: `Elastics::Configuration.variables[:index]`
        * `TYPE` String representing one or a list of types to dump.  Default: `Elastics::Configuration.variables[:type]`
        * `SCROLL` elasticsearch option for the scan_type search performed to retrieve the documents. Default: `'5m'`
        * `SIZE` Represents the number of documents per shard dumped at a time. Default: `50`
        * `VERBOSE` Prints informations during the process. Default: `true`

        It reload/restore the index by loading a dump file (produced by the the `elastics:admin:dump`)

        > __Notice__: It loads the data into the original index name. If you want to reload the data into another index, you must set the `INDEX_MAP` variable.

        #### Environment variables

        * `FILE` The path to the dump file. Default: `'./elastics.dump'`

        * `TIMEOUT` The HTTP-client timeout. Default `20` for this task. (it is usually `5` for regular queries as set in `Configuration.http_client_options[:timeout]`).  You might need a higher timeout if you raise the `BATCH_SIZE`.
