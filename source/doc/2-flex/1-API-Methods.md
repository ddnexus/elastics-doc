# API Methods

Flex exposes the full elasticsearch API as own class methods. You will need to use them directly only for advanced usage, however Flex uses them internally and creates them with just a few lines of yaml. Indeed they are just generated by Generic Templates {% see 2.2.1#flex_generic_templates %}.

The naming of these methods tries to conform with the original elasticsearch documentation, and adds a few aliases for convenience.

As any template-generated method, they accept a list of variables (hashes) for interpolation {% see 2.2.4, 2.2.5 %}. This documentation reports the underlying templates and the usage examples complete with all the accepted variable, for completeness. Please, notice that you can omit variables that have defaults.

When an API has flags/parameters, you can pass them as the `:params` variable; when it has structured data you can pass it as the `:data` variable.

> __Notice__: you can get the updated full reference and usage example of these methods also in the console at any time, by just writing `Flex.doc` (for the full API) or `Flex.doc :create_index, :get_index_mapping, ...` (for specific methods).
