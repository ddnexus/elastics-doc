# API Methods

Flex exposes the full elasticsearch API Methods as own class methods. You will probably never need to use them directly, however Flex uses them internally and creates them with just a few lines of yaml. Indeed they are just generated by Generic Templates {% see 2.2.1#flex_generic_templates %}.

The naming of these methods tries to conform with the original elasticsearch documentation (using the file name of the original elasticsearch url), and adds a few aliases for convenience.

As any template-generated method, they accept a list of variables (hashes) for interpolation {% see 2.2.4, 2.2.5 %}. This documentation reports the underlying templates and the usage examples complete with all the accepted variable, for completeness. Please, notice that you can omit variables that have defaults.

**Notice**: you can get the updated full reference and usage example of these methods also in the console at any time, by just doing:


{% highlight irb %}
>> Flex.doc
{% endhighlight %}

or limiting the output to a particular method like:

{% highlight irb %}
>> Flex.doc :create_index
{% endhighlight %}

## Methods

{% slim API_methods_table.slim %}

> If you find any elasticsearch API missing from this list, please, let me know and I will add it right away (it should be just a matter of a couple of minutes)
