# Variables

When you call a generated method (originated by a template), you can pass a list of hashes of variables that will be interpolated into the templates.

> __Notice__: We will use just one hash in the following examples, but you can actually pass a list of hashes that will be deep merged into one single hash {% see 2.3.4#7_single_call_level Single Call Level %}.

For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
my_search:
- query:
    term:
      color: <<the_color>>
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ruby %}
MyClass.my_search :the_color => 'blue'
{% endhighlight %}

You know that you can also set a tag default {% see 2.3.3 %}:

{% highlight yaml %}
my_search:
- query:
    term:
      color: <<the_color= blue >>
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ruby %}
MyClass.my_search
{% endhighlight %}

but you can also set a default for all the `the_color` tags in the source file, or for all the source files used by your class, or for all the requests of your app, etc. by setting them at different levels.

## Variable Levels

Elastics allows you to set interpolation variables at different levels, affecting different ranges of requests. They act as sort of cascading defaults, so you can minimize the code needed to set the right value, which is somehow similar to what you do with CSSs.

That is internally achieved by deep-merging all the `Elastics::Variables` objects in the cascading hierarchy of levels, from the most general to the most specific. More specific variable levels override more general levels.

Here they are, from the most general to the most specific:

### 1. Configuration Level

Variables set at configuration level will set the default for all the requests of your application and can be overridden by all the other levels. You usually set them by merging or deep-merging your values into the `Elastics::Variables` object contained in `Elastics::Configuration.variables` so preserving the values already there:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.variables.deep_merge! :the_color => 'green'
{% endhighlight %}

{% see 1.3 %}

### 2. Template Class level

This is mostly used internally by the `Elastics::Template::*` subclasses. You might need it if you want to create a custom template class. In that case take a look at the implementation of [elastics/template/slim_search](https://github.com/ddnexus/elastics/blob/master/lib/elastics/template/slim_search.rb).

{% highlight ruby %}
class MyTemplateClass < Elastics::Template
  def self.variables
    super.deep_merge(:the_color => 'blue')
  end
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. Host Class level (your class)

When you want to set a default variable for all the requests from your own class (context class) you can simply add the variables to the `elastics` class proxy of your class:

{% highlight ruby %}
class MyClass
  include Elastics::Templates
  elastics.variables.deep_merge!(:the_color => 'red')
  elastics.load_source :my_source
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

### 4. Source Level

When you want to set a default variable for all the requests generated by the same source file you can do so in the loading statement:

{% highlight ruby %}
elastics.load_source :my_source, :the_color => 'black'
{% endhighlight %}

{% see 2.3.2 %}

### 5. Instance Template Level

This level is specially useful when you want to set a variable at the template level (i.e. affecting all the requests made with that template), but you cannot use tag defaults because that tag is not explicit in your template. This is usually the case of the tags used in the `path`, such as `:index`, `:type` or (query) `:params` that are not accessible from Search Templates. In the following template, the second argument is used as template variables. In this case we want to use the `car` and `truck` default types when we use that template.

{% highlight yaml %}
my_search:
- query:
    term:
      color: <<the_color>>
- type:
  - car
  - truck
{% endhighlight %}

### 6. Tag Level

This is a quite specific level: may be overridden only by the call argument below.

{% highlight yaml %}
- <<the_color= yellow >>
{% endhighlight %}

### 7. Single Call Level

This is the most specific level where you can set a variable, indeed it affects only that single request and overrides any other level that may set `:the_color`.

{% highlight ruby %}
MyClass.my_search :the_color => 'white'
{% endhighlight %}


Besides, all the methods that accept a variable hash, can accept a list of hashes as well. The list will be deep-merged and the resulting hash will be used as the final variable hash passed as the arguments. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
MyClass.my_search @default_controller_vars, params, :the_color => 'pink'
{% endhighlight %}

The order is important: in this case we pass 3 hashes: the 3rd hash will override the 2nd, which will override the 1st.

## Special Variables

Variables are usually created by you: their primary function is supplying the values to replace the tags, but there are a few variables that are special because they have a different function, so you cannot define a tag with their name. They are mostly set and used internally, but you might need to pass it explicitly in some special case.

{% slim special_variables_table.slim %}

## Predefined Variables

Elastics defines a few tags internally, so it adds some predefined variable to the set. For example, when you use Search Templates, you have more predefined variables:

{% slim predefined_variables_table.slim %}

> When you use other API methods (e.g. `Elastics.multi_get`, `Elastics.stats`, ...), you may need to set other variables as well {% see 2.2 %}.
> As usual you can get the variables and an usage example in the console with `Elastics.doc`

## Elastics Variables Structure

When you pass a variable hash (or list of hashes) to any elastics method, elastics will create an internal `Elastics::Variables` instance, which is a special `Hash` instance.

* The `Elastics::Variables` objects are aware of the elasticsearch/elastics usage and its special variables
* They are deep-mergeable and prunable
* Deep-merging is done both for hashes and arrays in the stucture
* Their keys are automatically symbolized
